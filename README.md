Here's the thing: I don't like the current chess software selection >:( 
So I decided to **trrry** making my own for my personal study.

Here are the features I want:
- a nice-looking board,
- import and annotate games (PGN for now),
- engine analysis,
- opening tree,
- database lookup.

Here are features I do not care about (for now):
- tournaments,
- play against the engine,
- FICS,
- Lichess integration.

I'm also thinking of implementing my own chess database format because why not 
at this point. Can I beat `si5`? Stay tuned to find out.
